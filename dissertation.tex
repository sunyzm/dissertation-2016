With the advent of ever more advanced and affordable 3D data acquisition
technologies, digitalized 3D shapes have become ubiquitous in our daily life
and occupied important roles in numerous fields and applications. Although
it is straightforward to represent shape geometry directly in the spatial
domain, there is a growing body of literature dedicated to Fourier domain
shape modeling based on graph spectral basis. The Laplacian eigenfunctions
of manifold Laplacian form an orthonormal basis of the shape function space,
enabling Fourier-like space-frequency analysis on manifold. In addition, the
Laplacian eigenfunctions encode substantial intrinsic topological and geometric
information of the mesh and have widespread applications in shape analysis.

In this dissertation, we aim to extend traditional spectral mesh processing
by incorporating spectral graph wavelets (SGWs) and sparsity-seeking
algorithms. Spectral graph wavelets are defined with the eigenfunctions of
graph Laplacian, with scaling implemented in the spectral domain. Unlike
Laplacian eigenbasis which are localized in frequency but have global support
in space, the SGWs are localized in both space and frequency domain, thus are
more suitable for representing local geometry. In recent years, sparsity has
become an important concept in signal processing applications. By providing a
rich, often redundant, dictionary of elementary vectors and forcing certain
sparsity-constraints, a signal usually can be decomposed into or well
approximated by the linear combination of very few vectors, giving rise to a
sparse coefficient representation that is not only more concise but also, in
many cases, more precise than the original representation.

Conventional spectral mesh compression employs the eigenfunctions of mesh
Laplacian as shape bases, which are highly inefficient in representing local
geometry. To ameliorate, we advocate an innovative approach to 3D mesh
compression using spectral graph wavelets as dictionary to encode mesh geometry.
The spectral graph wavelets are locally defined at individual vertices and can
better capture local shape information than Laplacian eigenbasis. The
multi-scale spectral graph wavelets form a redundant dictionary as shape basis,
so we formulate the compression of 3D shape as a sparse approximation problem
that can be readily handled by greedy pursuit algorithms.

Surface inpainting refers to the completion or recovery of missing shape
geometry based on the shape information that is currently available. We
devise a new surface inpainting algorithm founded upon the theory and
techniques of sparse signal recovery. Instead of estimating the missing
geometry directly, our novel method is to find this low-dimensional
representation which describes the entire original shape. More specifically,
we find that, for many shapes, the vertex coordinate function can be well
approximated by a very sparse coefficient representation with respect to the
dictionary comprising its Laplacian eigenbasis, and it is then possible to
recover this sparse representation from partial measurements of the original
shape. Taking advantage of the sparsity cue, we advocate a novel variational
approach for surface inpainting, integrating data fidelity constraints on the
shape domain with coefficient sparsity constraints on the transformed domain.
Because of the powerful properties of Laplacian eigenbasis, the inpainting
results of our method tend to be globally coherent with the remaining shape.

Informative and discriminative feature descriptors are vital in qualitative and
quantitative shape analysis for a large variety of graphics applications. We
advocate novel strategies to define generalized, user-specified features on
shapes. Our new region descriptors are primarily built upon the the
coefficients of spectral graph wavelets that are both multi-scale and
multi-level in nature, consisting of both local and global information. Based
on our novel spectral feature descriptor, we developed a user-specified feature
detection framework and a tensor-based shape matching algorithm.

Through various experiments, we demonstrate the competitive performance of our
proposed methods and the great potential of redundant spectral basis and
sparsity-driven methods for shape modeling. We conclude this dissertation by
discussing some remaining challenges and new research directions.
