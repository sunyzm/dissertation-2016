\chapter{Introduction}

With the advent of ever more advanced and affordable 3D data acquisition
technologies, digitalized 3D shapes have become ubiquitous in our daily
life and played indispensable roles in numerous fields and applications,
including computer-aided design, entertainment industry, medical research, etc.
Although it is straightforward to represent and manipulate shape geometry
directly in the spatial domain, in recent years there has been a growing trend
towards spectral shape analysis, leveraging the eigen-structures of various mesh
operators, especially the Laplacian operator. In this chapter, we give an overview of
the main theme of this dissertation: spectral representations and sparsity-driven
algorithms for shape modeling and analysis.

\section{Problem Statement}

In order to effectively encode 3D geometric data and facilitate different
shape analysis and processing tasks, many different shape representations have
been developed and adopted, including point clouds, polygon meshes, spline surfaces,
voxels, etc. Choosing the most appropriate representation generally depends on the
specific data source and task at handï¼Œbut of all these representations,
polygon meshes, especially triangle meshes, are perhaps the most widely used.
Thanks to its conceptual simplicity, the discrete mesh representation is flexible, versatile,
and highly efficient for batch processing and rendering.

From the point of view of signal processing, the vertex coordinate function of
a mesh is essentially a vector-valued discrete signal defined on the domain of
mesh vertices, just like an image is a color-valued signal defined on 2D grids.
Naturally, the countless successful applications of digital signal processing with conventional
types of signals, such as audio and images, have long motivated people to employ 
and adapt signal processing techniques to solve shape modeling problems in the 
mesh domain. For instance, in one of the pioneering works~\cite{Taubin1995} on 
geometric signal processing, Taubin showed that the operation of surface smoothing 
can be carried out by applying the graph Laplacian operator to the mesh coordinates, 
which is equivalent to low-pass filtering of discrete signals defined on vertices.

One key aspect of signal processing is \emph{transform}, i.e., to explicitly represent 
the signal in a transform domain by decomposing it as the linear combination of a suitable
choice of basis vectors. Analyzing the coefficient representation with respect to the transform
basis can often reveal important properties of the original signal, and many
operations that are difficult to perform directly on the spatial domain
can be easily accomplished in the transform domain by manipulating the
coefficients. In Euclidean space, the most fundamental transform
is the well known Fourier transform, which converts signals from time/space domain to
frequency domain with multi-scale sinusoids as basis. 

The classic Fourier basis functions are actually the eigenfunctions of the second-order 
differential operator in Euclidean space, corresponding to the spectra of 1D Laplacian.
In general, spectral analysis refers to the analysis in terms of the
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of certain linear operator. 

In the context of geometry processing and analysis, the natural equivalent to the 
Fourier basis is the set of eigenfunctions of the mesh's Laplacian operator.
According to the spectral graph theory, the Laplacian eigenfunctions form an 
orthonormal and complete basis of functions defined on the mesh vertices, thus inducing the
graph Fourier transform which affords space-frequency decomposition of functions defined on 
the surface, analogous to the Fourier transform in regular domains. 

Unlike classic Fourier basis functions which are simply fixed sinusoids, the manifold harmonic 
basis differ with the connectivity, geometry, and the type of Laplacian operator that is 
adopted~\cite{Zhang:2010:CGF}. As a result, the mesh Laplacian eigenvectors and eigenvalues 
actually encode substantial topological and geometric information and can help characterize 
the global shape property and reveal intrinsic structure of the original mesh. This lends 
to the popularity of spectral methods for shape analysis and processing, including 
compression~\cite{Karni2000}, segmentation~\cite{Liu2007}, deformation~\cite{Rong2008}, 
remeshing~\cite{dong2006spectral}, paramterization~\cite{Zhou2004}, shape indexing~\cite{Reuter:2006:CAD},
and retrieval~\cite{Lavoue:2012}, to name just a few.

Myriads of successful applications notwithstanding, there are certain 
limitations in employing the Laplacian eigenpairs directly for shape analysis. 
Primarily, the Laplacian eigenvalues and eigenvectors are determined by the 
global Laplacian matrix and thus encode information of the entire shape. 
Hence, they are more suitable for representing the overall shape but are not 
very effective in encoding local details. In addition, the Laplacian eigenpairs 
are not very stable across shapes and direct comparisons become unreliable 
after the first few eigenpairs. To more effectively describing the properties 
of local regions and the pair-wise relations between regions in a shape, people
have developed a series of sophisticated spectral representations building upon 
the Laplacian eigenpairs, including various forms of kernels and distances.

In recent years, the focus of harmonic analysis has been moving from orthogonal 
basis with minimum size like the Fourier basis to richer, more expressive 
dictionaries with many redundant atoms such as wavelets, and from simple 
determinant time-frequency transform to coefficient decomposition based on 
sparsity-seeking optimization. Comparing with Fourier-based signal processing,
richer dictionaries allows more flexibility in basis design and affords greater 
expressive power. With suitable dictionary and appropriate sparse optimization 
algorithm, the obtained representation can provide a very concise description or 
approximation of the original signal, help manifest a signal's essential 
components, and potentially facilitate a diversity of applications such as signal 
compression, pattern recognition, noise reduction, source separation and signal 
restoration.

The concepts of redundant dictionary and sparse representation have gained great momentum
in the signal processing community~\cite{Mallat2008}, but most existing study focused on 
regular domains such as images and audio rather than the more challenging and universal 
problem of signal processing on graphs. In this dissertation, we will present our research 
work in shape analysis and processing by incorporating spectral representations and sparse 
modeling techniques.

The basic idea of sparse modeling is to use as few as possible elementary functions chosen
in a dictionary to decompose or approximate a signal, based on the intuition that a meaningful
high-dimensional signal probably possesses a low-dimensional intrinsic structure, which can be
captured by a sparse coefficient representation with respect to a suitable dictionary. Given a
redundant dictionary, we can compute a sparse decomposition or approximation of the original signal
by using various sparse optimization algorithms. The obtained sparse representation provides not
only a more concise description of the original signal, which can be utilized for signal compression,
but also, in many cases, a more precise and structure-revealing one.

The efficacy of sparsity-driven algorithms highly depends on the selection of dictionaries.
Generally, the more ``expressive'' the dictionary is, the fewer elementary functions
are needed to faithfully reconstruct the original signal, as there are more ``words''
available to express the information. Hence, instead of selecting a complete and orthogonal basis
like the Fourier basis as the dictionary, it is often desirable to construct a redundant, overcomplete
dictionary.

A natural choice for constructing redundant dictionary is to use wavelets. A family
of wavelets can be generated by scaling and translating a single mother wavelet function,
forming a rich dictionary of elementary signals of different frequencies and centered
at different locations. However, defining wavelets and wavelet transform on mesh or
manifold domain have always been a challenging problem, since there is no intuitive way
to define scaling on irregular mesh grids. Recently, Hammond et al. proposed the spectral
graph wavelets (SGWs) and spectral graph wavelet transform (SGWT)~\cite{Hammond2011}
, in which the wavelet functions are defined with the spectral graph basis and scaling is carried
out in the Fourier domain. The SGWs constitute an overcomplete wavelet frame, whose properties
such as multiscale and spatial-locality of SGWs have proved to be valuable in a variety of data
analysis applications.

In addition to acting as overcomplete basis for shape signals, the spectral
graph wavelets also captures valuable intrinsic geometric information of the original
shape in a multiscale and spatially-localized way, thus are a promising choice to
serve as the building blocks for constructing local shape descriptors.

In this dissertation, we present solutions combining graph-based spectral
representations, especially spectral graph wavelets, and sparse modeling
methods to a series of fundamental problems in shape analysis and geometry 
processing, including mesh compression, surface inpainting, feature description, 
shape correspondence and shape retrieval. Through various experiments, we 
demonstrate the competitive performance of our proposed methods and the great 
potential of spectral representations and sparse modeling in shape analysis and processing. 
Fig.~\ref{fig:thesis_hierarchy} highlights the hierarchy of our methodology. 
Specifically, the contributions of this dissertations are summarized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item We present an innovative approach to 3D mesh compression using spectral graph
wavelets as dictionary to encode mesh geometry. In contrast to
Laplacian eigenbasis, the spectral graph wavelets are locally
defined at individual vertices and can better capture local shape
information in a more accurate way. Nonetheless, the multi-scale
spectral graph wavelets form a redundant dictionary as shape bases,
so we formulate the compression of 3D shape as a sparse
approximation problem that can be readily handled by
algorithms such as orthogonal matching pursuit. Various experiments
demonstrate that our method are superior to the existing spectral
mesh compression methods.

\item  We devise a new algorithm for completing surface with
  missing geometry and topology founded upon the theory and techniques
  of sparse signal recovery. We find that for many shapes the vertex coordinate function
  can be well approximated by a very sparse coefficient representation with respect
  to the dictionary comprising its Laplacian eigenbases, and it is then possible to
  recover this sparse representation from partial measurements of the original shape.
  Taking advantage of the sparsity cue, we advocate a novel
  variational approach for surface inpainting, integrating data
  fidelity constraints on the shape domain with coefficient sparsity
  constraints on the transformed domain. Because of the powerful
  properties of Laplacian eigenbases, the inpainting results of our
  method tend to be smooth and globally coherent with the remaining
  shape. We demonstrate the performance of our new method via various
  examples in geometry restoration, shape repair, and hole filling.

\item We propose a new kind of shape feature descriptors built upon the
  coefficients of spectral graph wavelets and biharmonic distance fields.
  Our novel descriptors are both multi-scale and multi-level in nature,
  effectively encoding both local and global information
  for the characterization of user-specified feature regions.
  Via extensive experiments and comprehensive comparisons with the state-of-the-art,
  our descriptor has exhibited many attractive advantages such as being geometry-aware,
  versatile, robust, discriminative, and isometry-invariant.

\item We develop effective feature-driven articulated shape
correspondence and retrieval algorithms based on spectral
descriptors. For coarse matching, we adopt tensor-based high-order 
graph matching to maximizes the geometric compatibility between 
features tuples, and for dense matching, we present a hierarchical 
shape registration algorithm, generating correspondence in multiples 
levels in a coarse-to-fine manner. We also propose the novel 
Bag-of-Feature-Graph (BoFG) descriptor for shape retrieval. 
For each geometric word in the vocabulary, BoFG constructs a graph that records
spatial relations of all feature pairs in the shape, weighted by their
similarities to this word. The BoFG descriptor significantly reducing the 
number of points required for computing distributions in comparisons 
with more traditional Bag-of-Words descriptors.
