\chapter{Introduction}

With the advent of ever more advanced and affordable 3D data acquisition
technologies, digitalized 3D shapes have become ubiquitous in our daily 
life and played indispensable roles in numerous fields and applications, 
including computer-aided design, entertainment industry, medical research, etc. 
Although it is straightforward to represent and process shape geometry directly
in the spatial domain, in recent years there has been a growing trend towards 
shape modeling in transform domains based on the graph spectral basis. 
In this chapter, we elaborate the main theme of this dissertation:
spectral representations and sparsity-driven algorithms for shape modeling
and analysis.

\section{Problem Statement}

In order to effectively encode 3D geometric data and facilitate different 
shape analysis and processing tasks, many different shape representations have
been developed, including point clouds, polygon meshes, spline surfaces, 
voxels, etc. Choosing the most appropriate representation generally depends on the
specific data source and geometric task at handï¼Œ but of all these representations,
polygon meshes, especially triangle meshes, are perhaps the most widely used.
Thanks to the conceptual simplicity, triangle meshes are flexible, versatile, 
and highly efficient for batch processing and rendering. 

In principle, a triangle mesh $\mathcal{M}$ can be viewed as the geometric 
embedding of a graph structure $G$ into $\mathbb{R}^3$. In another word,
$\mathcal{M}$ can be decomposed into the topological component, namely the 
underlying graph structure $G$, and the geometric component, i.e., the 
vertex coordinate function $\mathbf{P}$ which maps each vertex $v_i$ of
the graph to a position in the 3D Euclidean space $p_i\in\mathbb{R}^3$.

From the point of view of signal processing, the vertex coordinate function of 
a mesh is essentially a vector-valued discrete signal defined on the domain of 
mesh vertices, just like an image is a color-valued signal defined on 2D grids. 
The enormous success of applications of digital signal processing with other types 
of signals, such as audio and images, has long motivated people to employ and 
adapt techniques in classic signal processing to tackle geometry 
processing problems in the mesh domain. For instance, in one of the pioneering 
works~\cite{Taubin1995} on geometric signal processing, Taubin showed that the
process of surface smoothing can be carried out by applying the graph Laplacian 
operator to the mesh coordinates, which is equivalent to low-pass filtering
of discrete signals defined on vertices.  

One key aspect of signal processing is to represent the signal in a transform
domain by decomposing it as the linear combination of a suitable choice of basis
vectors. Analyzing the coefficient representation with respect to the transform 
basis can often reveal important properties of the original signal, and many
shape operations that are difficult to achieve directly on the mesh domain 
can be easily accomplished in the transform domain by filtering the 
transform coefficients. In Euclidean space, the most fundamental signal transform 
is the well known Fourier transform, which converts signals from time/space domain to 
frequency domain with multi-scale sinusoids as basis.  

In the general manifold domain, the natural equivalent to the classic Fourier basis is
the manifold harmonic basis (MHB)~\cite{Vallet2008}, also known as the Laplacian eigenbasis, 
which is actually the set of eigenfunctions of the manifold's Laplace-Beltrami operator.
According to the spectral theory, the Laplacian eigenfunctions form an orthonormal and complete
basis of functions defined on the manifold, thus inducing the manifold harmonic transform (MHT) 
which affords Fourier-like space-frequency decomposition on the manifold. In the discrete setting, 
MHB refers to the eigenvectors of the mesh/graph Laplacian matrix. 

Unlike classic Fourier basis functions which are simply fixed sinusoids, the manifold harmonic basis 
differ with the connectivity, geometry, and the type of Laplacian operator that is adopted~\cite{Zhang:2010:CGF}. 
As a result, the mesh Laplacian eigenvectors and eigenvalues actually encode substantial topological and
geometric information and can help characterize the global shape property and reveal intrinsic structure of the 
original mesh. This lends to the popularity of spectral methods in 
the area of geometry processing and analysis, such as compression~\cite{Karni2000}, 
segmentation~\cite{Liu2007}, deformation~\cite{Rong2008}, remeshing~\cite{dong2006spectral},
paramterization~\cite{Zhou2004}, shape indexing~\cite{Reuter:2006:CAD, Rustamov:2007:LEF}, etc. 

Myriads of successful applications notwithstanding, there are certain limitations in employing the Laplacian
eigenpairs directly for shape analysis. Primarily, the Laplacian eigenvalues and eigenvectors are determined 
by the global Laplacian matrix and thus encode information of the entire shape. Hence, they are more suitable
for representing the overall shape but are not very effective in encoding local details. In addition, the Laplacian
eigenpairs are not very stable across shapes and direct comparisons become unreliable after the first few eigenpairs.
To more effectively describing the properties of local regions and the pair-wise relations between regions 
in a shape, people have developed a series of sophisticated spectral representations building upon the 
Laplacian eigenpairs, including various forms of kernels and distances.

In recent years, redundant dictionary and sparse representation have gained great momentum in the field of
signal processing~\cite{Mallat2008}. The focus of harmonic analysis has been moving from orthogonal basis with 
minimum size like the Fourier basis to richer dictionaries with many redundant atoms such as wavelets, 
and from simple determinant time-frequency transform to coefficient decomposition based on sparsity-driven 
optimization. Comparing with Fourier-based signal processing, richer dictionaries are more flexible and have
greater expressive power. With appropriate sparsity-seeking algorithm, the obtained representation provides
not only a more concise description of the original signal, but also, in many cases, a more precise one. 
Thus, computing the sparse representation can help manifest the essential components of a signal, facilitating 
a wide range of applications such as signal compression, pattern recognition,
noise reduction, source separation, and signal restoration.

A natural choice for constructing redundant dictionary is to use wavelets. A family
of wavelets can be generated by scaling and translating a single mother wavelet function,
forming a rich dictionary of elementary signals of different frequencies and centered
at different locations. However, defining wavelets and wavelet transform on mesh or
manifold domain have always been a challenging problem, since there is no intuitive way
to define scaling on irregular mesh grids. Recently, Hammond et al. proposed the spectral
graph wavelets (SGWs) and spectral graph wavelet transform (SGWT)~\cite{Hammond2011}
, in which the wavelet functions are defined with the spectral graph basis and scaling is carried 
out in the Fourier domain. The SGWs constitute an overcomplete wavelet frame, whose properties 
such as multiscale and spatial-locality of SGWs have proved to be valuable in a variety of data
analysis applications.

Wavelets and sparse representations have achieved enormous success in regular domains 
such as images and audio, and should have great potential in the mesh domain as well. 
Currently, however, there is very few existing works taking advantages of graph wavelets 
and sparsity-seeking techniques for shape analysis and processing.

The basic idea of sparse representation is to use as few as possible elementary functions chosen
in a dictionary to decompose or approximate a signal, based on the intuition that a meaningful
high-dimensional signal probably possesses a low-dimensional intrinsic structure, which can be
captured by a sparse coefficient representation with respect to a suitable dictionary. Given a
redundant dictionary, we can compute a sparse decomposition or approximation of the original signal
by using various sparse optimization algorithms. The obtained sparse representation provides not
only a more concise description of the original signal, which can be utilized for signal compression,
but also, in many cases, a more precise one.

The efficacy of sparsity-based methods depends on the the selection of dictionaries.
Generally, the more ``expressive'' the dictionary is, the fewer elementary functions
are needed to faithfully reconstruct the original signal, as there are more ``words''
available to express the information. Hence, instead of selecting a complete and orthogonal basis
like the Fourier basis as the dictionary, it is often desirable to construct a redundant,
overcomplete dictionary containing a rich variety of elementary signals to achieve enhanced expressive power.
The spectral graph wavelets, with each atom localized in both space and frequency, provide a
natural and flexible way to construct overcomplete dictionaries of shape signals and have great expressive power.

In addition to acting as overcomplete basis for shape signals, the spectral graph wavelets also captures
valuable geometric information of the original shape in a multiscale and spatially-localized way,
thus are very suitable to constitute the building blocks of local shape descriptors. 

In this dissertation, we present solutions combining graph-based spectral representations,
especially spectral graph wavelets and heat kernels, and sparsity-seeking techniques to a series 
of fundamental problems in shape analysis and geometry processing, including mesh compression, 
surface inpainting, feature description, shape correspondence, and shape retrieval. 
Through various experiments, we demonstrate the competitive performance of our proposed methods and the great potential of 
spectral sparse representations. Fig.~\ref{fig:thesis_hierarchy} highlights the hierarchy of this dissertation. 


Specifically, the contributions of this dissertations are summarized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item We present an innovative approach to 3D mesh compression using spectral graph
wavelets as dictionary to encode mesh geometry. In contrast to
Laplacian eigenbasis, the spectral graph wavelets are locally
defined at individual vertices and can better capture local shape
information in a more accurate way. Nonetheless, the multi-scale
spectral graph wavelets form a redundant dictionary as shape bases,
so we formulate the compression of 3D shape as a sparse
approximation problem that can be readily handled by
algorithms such as orthogonal matching pursuit. Various experiments
demonstrate that our method are superior to the existing spectral
mesh compression methods.

\item  We devise a new algorithm for completing surface with
  missing geometry and topology founded upon the theory and techniques
  of sparse signal recovery. We find that for many shapes the vertex coordinate function
  can be well approximated by a very sparse coefficient representation with respect
  to the dictionary comprising its Laplacian eigenbases, and it is then possible to
  recover this sparse representation from partial measurements of the original shape.
  Taking advantage of the sparsity cue, we advocate a novel
  variational approach for surface inpainting, integrating data
  fidelity constraints on the shape domain with coefficient sparsity
  constraints on the transformed domain. Because of the powerful
  properties of Laplacian eigenbases, the inpainting results of our
  method tend to be smooth and globally coherent with the remaining
  shape. We demonstrate the performance of our new method via various
  examples in geometry restoration, shape repair, and hole filling.

\item We propose a new kind of shape feature descriptors built upon the
  coefficients of spectral graph wavelets and biharmonic distance fields. 
  Our novel descriptors are both multi-scale and multi-level in nature, 
  effectively encoding both local and global information 
  for the characterization of user-specified feature regions. 
  Via extensive experiments and comprehensive comparisons with the state-of-the-art, 
  our descriptor has exhibited many attractive advantages such as being geometry-aware, 
  versatile, robust, discriminative, and isometry-invariant.

\item We develop effective feature-driven articulated shape 
correspondence and retrieval algorithms based on spectral 
representations. Features are encoded with heat kernel signatures
or our SGW-derived feature descriptors. For coarse matching, we adopt
tensor-based high-order graph matching to maximizes the 
geometric compatibility between features tuples, and for dense matching,
we present a hierarchical shape registration algorithm, generating 
correspondence in multiples levels in a coarse-to-fine manner. We also
propose the novel Bag-of-Feature-Graph (BoFG) descriptor for shape retrieval
For each geometric word in the vocabulary, BoFG constructs a graph that records
spatial relations of all feature pairs in the shape, weighted by their 
similarities to this word. The BoFG descriptor significantly reducing the number 
of pointed required for computing distributions in comparisons with more traditional 
Bag-of-Features descriptors.
