  Abstract                 = {One of the biggest challenges in non-rigid shape retrieval and comparison is the design of a shape descriptor that would maintain invariance under a wide class of transformations the shape can undergo. Recently, heat kernel signature was introduced as an intrinsic local shape descriptor based on diffusion scale-space analysis. In this paper, we develop a scale-invariant version of the heat kernel descriptor. Our construction is based on a logarithmically sampled scale-space in which shape scaling corresponds, up to a multiplicative constant, to a translation. This translation is undone using the magnitude of the Fourier transform. The proposed scale-invariant local descriptors can be used in the bag-of-features framework for shape retrieval in the presence of transformations such as isometric deformations, missing data, topological noise, and global and local scaling. We get significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art algorithms on recently established non-rigid shape retrieval benchmarks.},

  Abstract                 = {The first part of this paper proposes an adaptive, data-driven threshold for image denoising via wavelet soft-thresholding. The threshold is derived in a Bayesian framework, and the prior used on the wavelet coefficients is the generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) widely used in image processing applications. The proposed threshold is simple and closed-form, and it is adaptive to each subband because it depends on data-driven estimates of the parameters. Experimental results show that the proposed method, called BayesShrink, is typically within 5\% of the MSE of the best soft-thresholding benchmark with the image assumed known. It also outperforms SureShrink (Donoho and Johnstone 1994, 1995; Donoho 1995) most of the time. The second part of the paper attempts to further validate claims that lossy compression can be used for denoising. The BayesShrink threshold can aid in the parameter selection of a coder designed with the intention of denoising, and thus achieving simultaneous denoising and compression. Specifically, the zero-zone in the quantization step of compression is analogous to the threshold value in the thresholding function. The remaining coder design parameters are chosen based on a criterion derived from Rissanen's minimum description length (MDL) principle. Experiments show that this compression method does indeed remove noise significantly, especially for large noise power. However, it introduces quantization noise and should be used only if bitrate were an additional concern to denoising},

  Abstract                 = {We present a novel approach for computing and solving the Poisson equation over the surface of a mesh. As in previous approaches, we define the Laplace-Beltrami operator by considering the derivatives of functions defined on the mesh. However, in this work, we explore a choice of functions that is decoupled from the tessellation. Specifically, we use basis functions (second-order tensor-product B-splines) defined over 3D space, and then restrict them to the surface. We show that in addition to being invariant to mesh topology, this definition of the Laplace-Beltrami operator allows a natural multiresolution structure on the function space that is independent of the mesh structure, enabling the use of a simple multigrid implementation for solving the Poisson equation.},

We show that eigenfunctions of Markov matrices can be used to construct coordinates called diffusion maps that generate efficient representations of complex geometric structures. The associated family of diffusion distances, obtained by iterating the Markov matrix, defines multiscale geometries that prove to be useful in the context of data parametrization and dimensionality reduction. The proposed framework relates the spectral properties of Markov processes to their geometric counterparts and it unifies ideas arising in a variety of contexts such as machine learning, spectral graph theory and eigenmap methods.},

  Abstract                 = {We address the problem of image deconvolution under I\&lt;sub\&gt;p\&lt;/sub\&gt; norm (and other) penalties expressed in the wavelet domain. We propose an algorithm based on the bound optimization approach; this approach allows deriving EM-type algorithms without using the concept of missing/hidden data. The algorithm has provable monotonicity both with orthogonal or redundant wavelet transforms. We also derive bounds on the l\&lt;sub\&gt;p\&lt;/sub\&gt; norm penalties to obtain closed form update equations for any p \&amp;isin; [0, 2]. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

  Abstract                 = {We use heat kernels or eigenfunctions of the Laplacian to construct local coordinates on large classes of Euclidean domains and Riemannian manifolds (not necessarily smooth, e.g., with $C^{\alpha}$ metric). These coordinates are bi-Lipschitz on large neighborhoods of the domain or manifold, with constants controlling the distortion and the size of the neighborhoods that depend only on natural geometric properties of the domain or manifold. The proof of these results relies on novel estimates, from above and below, for the heat kernel and its gradient, as well as for the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian and their gradient, that hold in the non-smooth category, and are stable with respect to perturbations within this category. Finally, these coordinate systems are intrinsic and efficiently computable, and are of value in applications.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the challenges in geometry processing is to automatically reconstruct a higher-level representation from raw geometric data. For instance, computing a parameterization of an object helps attaching information to it and converting between various representations. More generally, this family of problems may be thought of in terms of constructing structured function bases attached to surfaces. In this paper, we study a specific type of hierarchical function bases, defined by the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. When applied to a sphere, this function basis corresponds to the classical spherical harmonics. On more general objects, this defines a function basis well adapted to the geometry and the topology of the object. Based on physical analogies (vibration modes), we first give an intuitive view before explaining the underlying theory. We then explain in practice how to compute an approximation of the eigenfunctions of a differential operator, and show possible applications in geometry processing},

The algorithm is based on our previous algorithm [ 22] that employs</I> mesh-spectral analysis <I>to modify mesh shapes in their transformed domain. This paper presents extensions to our previous algorithm so that (1) much larger meshes can be watermarked within a reasonable time, and that (2) the watermark is robust against connectivity alteration (e.g., mesh simplification), and that (3) the watermark is robust against attacks that combine similarity transformation with such other attacks as cropping, mesh simplification, and smoothing. Experiment showed that our new watermarks are resistant against mesh simplification and remeshing combined with resection, similarity transformation, and other operations..</I>},

  Abstract                 = {A common operation in many geometry processing algorithms consists of finding correspondences between pairs of shapes by finding structure-preserving maps between them. A particularly useful case of such maps is isometries, which preserve geodesic distances between points on each shape. Although several algorithms have been proposed to find approximately isometric maps between a pair of shapes, the structure of the space of isometries is not well understood. In this paper, we show that under mild genericity conditions, a single correspondence can be used to recover an isometry defined on entire shapes, and thus the space of all isometries can be parameterized by one correspondence between a pair of points. Perhaps surprisingly, this result is general, and does not depend on the dimensionality or the genus, and is valid for compact manifolds in any dimension. Moreover, we show that both the initial correspondence and the isometry can be recovered efficiently in practice. This allows us to devise an algorithm to find intrinsic symmetries of shapes, match shapes undergoing isometric deformations, as well as match partial and incomplete models efficiently.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we propose a new wavelet transform applicable to functions defined on high dimensional data, weighted graphs and networks. The proposed method generalizes the Haar-like transform recently introduced by Gavish , and can also construct data adaptive orthonormal wavelets beyond Haar. It is defined via a hierarchical tree, which is assumed to capture the geometry and structure of the input data, and is applied to the data using a modified version of the common one-dimensional (1D) wavelet filtering and decimation scheme. The adaptivity of this wavelet scheme is obtained by permutations derived from the tree and applied to the approximation coefficients in each decomposition level, before they are filtered. We show that the proposed transform is more efficient than both the 1D and two-dimension 2D separable wavelet transforms in representing images. We also explore the application of the proposed transform to image denoising, and show that combined with a subimage averaging scheme, it achieves denoising results which are similar to those obtained with the K-SVD algorithm.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper introduces a method to extract ‘Shape-DNA’, a numerical fingerprint or signature, of any 2d or 3d manifold (surface or solid) by taking the eigenvalues (i.e. the spectrum) of its Laplace–Beltrami operator. Employing the Laplace–Beltrami spectra (not the spectra of the mesh Laplacian) as fingerprints of surfaces and solids is a novel approach. Since the spectrum is an isometry invariant, it is independent of the object's representation including parametrization and spatial position. Additionally, the eigenvalues can be normalized so that uniform scaling factors for the geometric objects can be obtained easily. Therefore, checking if two objects are isometric needs no prior alignment (registration/localization) of the objects but only a comparison of their spectra. In this paper, we describe the computation of the spectra and their comparison for objects represented by NURBS or other parametrized surfaces (possibly glued to each other), polygonal meshes as well as solid polyhedra. Exploiting the isometry invariance of the Laplace–Beltrami operator we succeed in computing eigenvalues for smoothly bounded objects without discretization errors caused by approximation of the boundary. Furthermore, we present two non-isometric but isospectral solids that cannot be distinguished by the spectra of their bodies and present evidence that the spectra of their boundary shells can tell them apart. Moreover, we show the rapid convergence of the heat trace series and demonstrate that it is computationally feasible to extract geometrical data such as the volume, the boundary length and even the Euler characteristic from the numerically calculated eigenvalues. This fact not only confirms the accuracy of our computed eigenvalues, but also underlines the geometrical importance of the spectrum. With the help of this Shape-DNA, it is possible to support copyright protection, database retrieval and quality assessment of digital data representing surfaces and solids.
A patent application based on ideas presented in this paper is pending.},

  Abstract                 = {The ICP (Iterative Closest Point) algorithm is widely used for geometric alignment of three-dimensional models when an initial estimate of the relative pose is known. Many variants of ICP have been proposed, affecting all phases of the algorithm from the selection and matching of points to the minimization strategy. We enumerate and classify many of these variants, and evaluate their effect on the speed with which the correct alignment is reached. In order to improve convergence for nearly-flat meshes with small features, such as inscribed surfaces, we introduce a new variant based on uniform sampling of the space of normals. We conclude by proposing a combination of ICP variants optimized for high speed. We demonstrate an implementation that is able to align two range images in a few tens of milliseconds, assuming a good initial guess. This capability has potential application to real-time 3D model acquisition and model-based tracking},

  Abstract                 = {This paper introduces a new shape matching algorithm for computing correspondences between 3D surfaces that have undergone (approximately) isometric deformations. The new approach makes two main contributions: First, the algorithm is, unlike previous work, robust to ldquotopological noiserdquo such as large holes or ldquofalse connectionsrdquo, which is both observed frequently in real-world scanner data. Second, our algorithm samples the space of feasible solutions such that uncertainty in matching can be detected explicitly. We employ a novel randomized feature matching algorithm in order to find robust subsets of geodesics to verify isometric consistency. The paper shows shape matching results for real world and synthetic data sets that could not be handled using previous deformable matching algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {Three-dimensional shape matching is a fundamental issue in computer vision with many applications such as shape registration, 3D object recognition, and classification. However, shape matching with noise, occlusion, and clutter is a challenging problem. In this paper, we analyze a family of quasi-conformal maps including harmonic maps, conformal maps, and least-squares conformal maps with regards to 3D shape matching. As a result, we propose a novel and computationally efficient shape matching framework by using least-squares conformal maps. According to conformal geometry theory, each 3D surface with disk topology can be mapped to a 2D domain through a global optimization and the resulting map is a diffeomorphism, i.e., one-to-one and onto. This allows us to simplify the 3D shape-matching problem to a 2D image-matching problem, by comparing the resulting 2D parametric maps, which are stable, insensitive to resolution changes and robust to occlusion, and noise. Therefore, highly accurate and efficient 3D shape matching algorithms can be achieved by using the above three parametric maps. Finally, the robustness of least-squares conformal maps is evaluated and analyzed comprehensively in 3D shape matching with occlusion, noise, and resolution variation. In order to further demonstrate the performance of our proposed method, we also conduct a series of experiments on two computer vision applications, i.e., 3D face recognition and 3D nonrigid surface alignment and stitching.},

  Abstract                 = {The analysis of 3-D shape meshes is a fundamental problem in computer vision, graphics, and medical imaging. Frequently, the needs of the application require that our analysis take a multi-resolution view of the shape's local and global topology, and that the solution is consistent across multiple scales. Unfortunately, the preferred mathematical construct which offers this behavior in classical image/signal processing, Wavelets, is no longer applicable in this general setting (data with non-uniform topology). In particular, the traditional definition does not allow writing out an expansion for graphs that do not correspond to the uniformly sampled lattice (e.g., images). In this paper, we adapt recent results in harmonic analysis, to derive Non-Euclidean Wavelets based algorithms for a range of shape analysis problems in vision and medical imaging. We show how descriptors derived from the dual domain representation offer native multi-resolution behavior for characterizing local/global topology around vertices. With only minor modifications, the framework yields a method for extracting interest/key points from shapes, a surprisingly simple algorithm for 3-D shape segmentation (competitive with state of the art), and a method for surface alignment (without landmarks). We give an extensive set of comparison results on a large shape segmentation benchmark and derive a uniqueness theorem for the surface alignment problem.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider the problem of automatically recognizing human faces from frontal views with varying expression and illumination, as well as occlusion and disguise. We cast the recognition problem as one of classifying among multiple linear regression models and argue that new theory from sparse signal representation offers the key to addressing this problem. Based on a sparse representation computed by C\&lt;sup\&gt;1\&lt;/sup\&gt;-minimization, we propose a general classification algorithm for (image-based) object recognition. This new framework provides new insights into two crucial issues in face recognition: feature extraction and robustness to occlusion. For feature extraction, we show that if sparsity in the recognition problem is properly harnessed, the choice of features is no longer critical. What is critical, however, is whether the number of features is sufficiently large and whether the sparse representation is correctly computed. Unconventional features such as downsampled images and random projections perform just as well as conventional features such as eigenfaces and Laplacianfaces, as long as the dimension of the feature space surpasses certain threshold, predicted by the theory of sparse representation. This framework can handle errors due to occlusion and corruption uniformly by exploiting the fact that these errors are often sparse with respect to the standard (pixel) basis. The theory of sparse representation helps predict how much occlusion the recognition algorithm can handle and how to choose the training images to maximize robustness to occlusion. We conduct extensive experiments on publicly available databases to verify the efficacy of the proposed algorithm and corroborate the above claims.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider the problem of finding a matching between two sets of features, given complex relations among them, going beyond pairwise. Each feature set is modeled by a hypergraph where the complex relations are represented by hyper-edges. A match between the feature sets is then modeled as a hypergraph matching problem. We derive the hyper-graph matching problem in a probabilistic setting represented by a convex optimization. First, we formalize a soft matching criterion that emerges from a probabilistic interpretation of the problem input and output, as opposed to previous methods that treat soft matching as a mere relaxation of the hard matching problem. Second, the model induces an algebraic relation between the hyper-edge weight matrix and the desired vertex-to-vertex probabilistic matching. Third, the model explains some of the graph matching normalization proposed in the past on a heuristic basis such as doubly stochastic normalizations of the edge weights. A key benefit of the model is that the global optimum of the matching criteria can be found via an iterative successive projection algorithm. The algorithm reduces to the well known Sinkhorn [15] row/column matrix normalization procedure in the special case when the two graphs have the same number of vertices and a complete matching is desired. Another benefit of our model is the straight-forward scalability from graphs to hyper-graphs.},

The singleton terms capture the geometric and appearance similarities (e.g., curvature and texture) while the high-order terms model the intrinsic embedding energy. The novelty of this paper includes: 1. casting 3D surface registration into a graph matching problem that combines both geometric and appearance similarities and intrinsic embedding information, 2. the first implementation of high-order graph matching algorithm that solves a non-convex optimization problem, and 3. an efficient two-stage optimization approach to constrain the search space for dense surface registration. Our method is validated through a series of experiments demonstrating its accuracy and efficiency, notably in challenging cases of large and/or non-isometric deformations, or meshes that are partially occluded.},

  Abstract                 = {Non-rigid 3D shape correspondence is a fundamental and difficult problem. Most applications which require a correspondence rely on manually selected markers. Without user assistance, the performances of existing automatic correspondence methods depend strongly on a good initial shape alignment or shape prior, and they generally do not tolerate large shape variations. We present an automatic feature correspondence algorithm capable of handling large, non-rigid shape variations, as well as partial matching. This is made possible by leveraging the power of state-of-the-art mesh deformation techniques and relying on a combinatorial tree traversal for correspondence search. The search is deformation-driven, prioritized by a self-distortion energy measured on meshes deformed according to a given correspondence. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to naturally match shapes which differ in pose, local scale, part decomposition, and geometric detail through numerous examples.},
